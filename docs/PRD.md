## Stepflow Library

---

### **1. Purpose and Overview**

The Workflow Automation Library is an open-source Node.js library designed to automate complex workflows, including AI-driven processes, data pipelines, and business logic automation. The library aims to be highly flexible, allowing for the creation of dynamic, stateful workflows with features such as conditional branching, context passing, state persistence, and more. It should be easy to use but powerful enough for advanced applications.

### **2. Key Features**

#### **2.1. Core Features**

1. **Step-Based Execution**

   - Define workflows as sequences of steps (functions) that can execute synchronously or asynchronously.
   - Support for method chaining to build workflows in a concise and readable manner.

2. **Context Management**

   - A shared `context` object that is passed through all steps, allowing for data sharing and modification.
   - Each step has access to and can modify the `context` object, enabling dynamic and adaptive workflows.

3. **Conditional Branching**

   - Built-in support for adding conditional logic (`if-else` structure) to split the workflow into sub-actions based on context.
   - Ability to create sub-workflows for different branches, supporting complex decision-making logic.

4. **Parallel and Sequential Execution**

   - Support for executing tasks in parallel or in sequence.
   - API for running steps concurrently, useful for data processing and AI model inference.

5. **Error Handling**

   - Graceful error handling to ensure the workflow can either continue or stop as needed.
   - Customizable error callbacks to handle failures at each step or globally.

#### **2.2. Advanced Features**

1. **State Management and Persistence**

   - Save and resume workflows from a specific state, enabling long-running workflows that can be paused and continued.
   - Integrate with databases (e.g., MongoDB, Redis) to store workflow states and context for persistence.

2. **Event-Based Execution**

   - Ability to wait for external events before continuing the workflow.
   - Example: Wait for a webhook or user input before executing the next step.

3. **Retry and Timeout Mechanisms**

   - Configurable retry logic for steps that may fail, with customizable backoff strategies.
   - Timeout settings for each step to prevent long-running operations from stalling the workflow.

4. **Context Validation and Transformation**

   - Built-in support for validating the `context` object before executing a step.
   - Context transformation functions to sanitize or preprocess data.

5. **AI Workflow Support**

   - Specialized methods for integrating with AI models and services, such as prebuilt steps for calling AI APIs or running model inference.
   - Example: Steps that preprocess data, call an AI model, and post-process the results.

6. **Audit Logging and Monitoring**

   - Detailed logging of each step, including input, output, and execution time.
   - Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog) to track workflow performance and failures.

7. **Admin Dashboard (Future Scope)**

   - A web-based UI for managing workflows, monitoring state, and debugging issues.
   - Visual representation of workflows, including step-by-step execution and condition branches.

### **3. Use Cases**

1. **Data Pipelines**

   - ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes that require complex data processing with conditional branching and parallel tasks.
   - Example: Data extraction from multiple sources, transformation based on conditions, and loading into a database.

2. **Business Logic Automation**

   - Automate approval processes, data synchronization, or user onboarding workflows.
   - Example: Automate the onboarding process, checking user roles and conditions before triggering certain actions.

3. **AI Model Workflows**

   - Orchestrate AI workflows that include data preprocessing, model inference, and post-processing.
   - Example: A workflow that processes input data, sends it to an AI model for prediction, and then formats the results.

4. **Event-Driven Workflows**

   - Automate workflows that are triggered by events, such as user actions, webhooks, or scheduled tasks.
   - Example: A workflow that waits for a file upload event, processes the file, and sends a notification.

### **4. Technical Specifications**

#### **4.1. Architecture**

- **Core Modules**:
  - `Workflow`: Main class for defining and running workflows.
  - `Step`: Wrapper for individual functions that make up the workflow.
  - `Condition`: Logic for branching workflows based on the context.
- **State Management**:
  - Integration with databases (e.g., MongoDB, Redis) for saving workflow states.
  - Mechanism to serialize and deserialize workflows for persistence.

#### **4.2. API Design**

1. **Workflow Class**

   ```javascript
   const workflow = new Workflow()
     .addStep(async (context) => {
       /* Step logic */
     })
     .addCondition(
       (context) => context.value > 50, // Condition
       new Workflow().addStep((ctx) => {
         /* True branch logic */
       }),
       new Workflow().addStep((ctx) => {
         /* False branch logic */
       })
     )
     .addStep((context) => {
       /* Final step */
     });
   ```

2. **Persistence API**

   - `saveState(workflowId)`: Saves the current state of the workflow to a database.
   - `loadState(workflowId)`: Loads and resumes a workflow from the saved state.

3. **Event-Based Execution**

   - `waitForEvent(eventName, callback)`: Pauses the workflow and waits for a specified event before continuing.

4. **Context Validation**

   - `validateContext(schema)`: Validates the context against a defined schema before executing a step.

### **5. Performance and Scalability**

- **Asynchronous Execution**: Use Node.js's async capabilities to handle I/O-bound operations efficiently.
- **Parallelism**: Built-in support for executing tasks in parallel to improve performance.
- **Load Testing**: Benchmark workflows to ensure they can handle high loads, especially for AI-driven workflows.

---

### **6. Security Considerations**

- **Input Sanitization**: Ensure all inputs to the context are sanitized to prevent security issues.
- **Access Control**: Restrict who can create, modify, or execute workflows, especially in shared environments.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data in the `context` when saving to persistent storage.

---

### **7. Future Enhancements**

1. **Admin Dashboard**: A visual interface for creating, editing, and monitoring workflows.
2. **Plugin System**: Allow developers to extend the library with custom plugins for specific integrations (e.g., database connectors, cloud services).
3. **Machine Learning Integration**: Prebuilt steps for common ML workflows, like data preprocessing, model inference, and result analysis.
